// begin creating your answer by creating the boilerplate version of the app by running npm create-react-app dogimageapp. This may take a while.
// move into this folder and write 'npm start' to start a live version of the app

// 1. Set up Your Dog.js file
//  a) copy and paste your Dog.js to begin file inside the src file 
//  b) import the Dog class in your App.js, and render the Dog component inside the App.js render method
//  c) check that the site has been updated to display the image and button from the dog.js file before continuing


// from now on you only need to edit Dog.js!
// 2. Create a state for what animal we want displayed
    // a) create a constructor that sets the initial state to animal: dog
    // b) update the render code so that if the state is equal to dog, the image address displays
            // otherwise it should display https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Cat_Janna.jpg/150px-Cat_Janna.jpg

// 3. Create a method that changes the state from dog to cat
    // make sure that when the button is clicked, the method gets called
    // the image should change from a dog to a cat and back again when clicked again
    // finally, use a ternary operator to change the button to read
    // 'i'm more of a cat person' when showing the dog, and 'i'm more of a dog person' when showing the cat
